Title: Flappy Chicken - A Beginner's Guide to Game Development in Java

Description:
Flappy Chicken is a simple yet addictive game developed in Java using the Swing library. It's inspired by the classic Flappy Bird game, where players control a bird and navigate it through a series of pipes.

The objective of Flappy Chicken is straightforward: keep the chicken flying for as long as possible without hitting any obstacles. The game environment consists of a bird, represented by a sprite, and pipes that the bird must fly through. The player controls the bird's altitude by pressing the spacebar, causing it to flap its wings and ascend briefly.

Here's a breakdown of the game mechanics:

1. Bird Control:
   - The player taps the spacebar to make the chicken flap its wings.
   - Each tap results in a brief upward movement, allowing the bird to navigate through the gaps between pipes.
   - Gravity constantly pulls the bird downward, so the player must time their taps carefully to maintain altitude.

2. Pipe Obstacles:
   - Pipes appear randomly on the screen, moving from right to left.
   - The bird must fly through the gaps between pipes to avoid collisions.
   - If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game ends.

3. Scoring:
   - The player earns points based on how far the bird travels through the pipes.
   - Passing through each set of pipes earns a point.
   - The player's score is displayed on the screen, providing feedback on their progress.

4. Start Screen:
   - The game begins with a start screen featuring a play button.
   - Clicking the play button starts the game and transitions to the gameplay screen.

Flappy Chicken is a beginner-friendly project that introduces fundamental concepts of game development, including graphics rendering, user input handling, collision detection, and game loop management. It's an excellent starting point for aspiring game developers to learn Java programming while creating a fun and engaging game.
